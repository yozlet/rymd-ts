# Rymd-ts

Wouldn't it be fun to write a version of Martin Jonasson's [Rymdkapsel](https://rymdkapsel.com/) in TypeScript? And then make it moddable?

This is a learning exercise for me to learn modern TypeScript, the Canvas API, Vite, and the basics of game development.

The repo looks like this because it's what you get when you run `bun create vite [APPNAME] --template vanilla-ts`.
